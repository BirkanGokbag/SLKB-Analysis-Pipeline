## SLKB: Synthetic lethality knowledge base for gene combination double knockout experiments

![Framework](images/SLKB.png)

Synthetic lethality knowledge base (SLKB) is dedicated to curating CRISPR dual knockdown/out experiments (CDKO) aimed to identify synthetic lethal (SL) interactions between two genes. [SLKB pipeline](https://github.com/BirkanGokbag/SLKB-Analysis-Pipeline) supports the following functions:

1) Storing user CDKO experiments under a generalized experimental design

2) Implementing and evaluating different SL scoring methods

3) Enabling data visualization and browsing

4) Support for SL target identification

Following SLKB pipeline, yielding results can be loaded within SLKB web app for full experience.
