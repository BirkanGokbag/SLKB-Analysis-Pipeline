**Helper Functions**

Helper functions are used across different functions within SLKB. You may use them as is or modify them to suit your needs.

## Helper R Functions

SLKB's helper functions are also located within the R environment. Functions for majority vote calculation, network visualization, and venn diagram creatios are located under the website's GitHub link. They are not included within the python package. 

To have access to those methods, you need to load in the functions to your R environment either through the URL or download them seperately through [SLKB web app](https://www.google.com)

```
source('/path/to/SLKB/repo/functions.R')
```

### create_venn_diagram

Returns the venn diagram for the yielded results.

```
create_venn_diagram(results, top_p = '10percent', output_dir = 'venn_results')
```

**Params**:

* results: Obtain as a result of running the ```SLKB_query``` on Python.
* top_p: Top percentage of pairs to consider as text (Default: '10percent')
    * If entered a number and without the keyword 'percent', then that many top pairs are considered.
* output_dir: Directory to produce results (Default: 'venn_results' folder in current working directory)

**Returns**:

* None

### create_SL_network

Create the SL network based on the pair file provided via VisNetwork. Normally, this is either the scores file or results file that is filtered by the user to include only the specified pairs. The network's edges are color coded based on ```color_base```, and the interactions between SL pairs are highlighted if ```target_genes``` is provided.

```
network <- create_SL_network(pair_file, color_base = None, target_genes = None, output_dir = 'network_results')
```

**Params**:

* pair_file: DataFrame of score file (via dplyr and dbPool) and/or result file from ```SLKB_query```.
* color_base: Criteria to color the edges of the SL network. Options: None (Default), 'cell_line_origin', 'study_origin'
* target_genes: A list of genes that are targeted for color coding. (Default: None.)
* output_dir: Directory to produce results (Default: 'network_results' folder in current working directory)

**Returns**:

* A visNetwork object
